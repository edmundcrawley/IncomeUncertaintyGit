    This paper uses a novel econometric method to estimate households' consumption responses to permanent and transitory shocks to income. Our method builds upon \cite{blundell_consumption_2008}, but correctly accounts for the time aggregation problem (\cite{working_note_1960}), which we show has led to large biases in previous estimates. Applying our method to a confidential panel dataset covering the entire Danish population, we are able to show heterogeneity in consumption responses, particularly across households with different levels of liquid wealth. We estimate a consumption response to transitory shocks that is at the high end of the existing literature.
